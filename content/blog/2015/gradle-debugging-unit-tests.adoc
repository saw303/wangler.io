= Debugging unit tests in a Gradle build

Have you ever been in need to analyse why a unit test is failing in your Gradle build but perfectly works in your IDE? No problem. Simply use Gradle in the *non daemon mode* and set the `org.gradle.debug` property to `true`.

    gradle --no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.debug=true clean check

After that set your breakpoints in your source code and attach your IDE debugger to the Gradle process.
