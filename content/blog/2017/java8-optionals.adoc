= Using Java 8 Optional

:juo: java.util.Optional

Recently I was wondering why IntelliJ IDEA keeps warning me about using `{juo}` as parameters of methods.
Why can't I use this comfortable wrapper type as input parameters? So I did some research and I would like to share the outcome
with you.

Let's pretend there is a method signature like as follows

[source, java]
----
/**
* This method simply does something.
*
* @param name mandatory name of someone
* @param age optional age of someone
*/
public void doSomething(String name, Optional<Integer> age) {
   // some mighty code that does something
}
----

What could possibly be the problem with that signature that IntelliJ tries to convince me not writing such code?

****
'Optional<Integer>' used as type for parameter 'age' less... (âŒ˜F1)
Reports any uses of {juo}<T>, java.util.OptionalDouble, java.util.OptionalInt, java.util.OptionalLong or com.google.common.base.Optional as the type for a field or a parameter.
Optional was designed to provide a limited mechanism for library method return types where there needed to be a clear way to represent "no result".
Using a field with type {juo} is also problematic if the class needs to be Serializable, which {juo} is not.
****

Alright, I understand that I should not use it as a field. But why not using it as an input parameter?
Is it because it is bad design? Because developers that are calling that method are forced to write something ugly like this?

[source, java]
----
obj.doSomething(
      "Silvio Wangler",
      Optional.of(new Integer(32)) // <1>
);
----
<1> Ugly because we force the caller to wrap the Integer into a `{juo}`

Take a look at the preceding example. Isn't it an ugly API is it? Well I would not want to code against this API either.
So this might be the reason why I is not recommended to use {juo} as input parameters in method signatures.

But what is the recommendation? Let's refactor the method for a smoother API. Let's remove that {juo}.

[source, java]
----
/**
* This method simply does something.
*
* @param name mandatory name of someone
* @param age optional age of someone
*/
public void doSomething(String name, Integer age) {
   Objects.requiredNonNull(name); // <1>

   Optional<Integer> possibleAge = Optional.ofNullable(age); // <2>

   possibleAge.ifPresent(System.out::println); // <3>
}
----
<1> Enforce that `name` is mandatory.
<2> Wrap that optional `age` parameter into an {juo}.
<3> Only do something with `age` if this is an non null value.

Well that seems to be the way to do it. That way I am not forcing my API callers to write boiler plate code and I as author of
that method care about the mandatory/optional validation. And in order to provide more convenience to the API user I could even
overwrite the method `doSomething` and hide this optional parameter.

[source, java]
----
/**
* This method simply does something.
*
* @param name mandatory name of someone
*/
public void doSomething(String name) {
   doSomething(name, null); // <1>
}
----
<1> Delegate the call and set age to `null`.
