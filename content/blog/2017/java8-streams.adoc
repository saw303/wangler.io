= Java 8 Streams - Flatten collections

:jul: java.util.List

Recently I had to find a way to flatten a `{jul}` that contains another `{jul}` using Java 8 streams.
Let's take the following {jul} `manyLists` as example.

[source, java]
----
List<List<String>> manyLists = new ArrayList<>();

manyLists.add(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C"));
manyLists.add(Arrays.asList("X", "Y", "Z"));
manyLists.add(Arrays.asList("1", "2", "3"));
----

Before Java 8 I would have implemented it maybe like that

[source, java]
----
List<String> all = new ArrayList<>();

for (List<String> list: manyLists) {
  all.addAll(list);
}
----

Since we got streams in Java 8 there is another possibly to solve the problem

[source, java]
----
List<String> all = manyLists.stream()
        .flatMap(List::stream) // <1>
        .collect(Collectors.toList()); // <2>

System.out.println(all);
----
<1> flattens the `List<List<String>>` to a stream of `List<String>`
<2> returns the stream a new list

This results in `[A, B, C, X, Y, Z, 1, 2, 3]`.
