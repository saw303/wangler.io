= Upload a file to a Docker container
Silvio Wangler

If you need to upload a file into a running Docker container you can do this as follows

[source, sh]
----
cat missing_data.sql | docker exec -i <your container name> sh -c 'cat >/missing_data.sql'
----

Afterwards the file is located inside the container at `/missing_data.sql`

Have fun!
