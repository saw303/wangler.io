= Split large Git repositories

Go into your big Git repository.

    cd ~/my-big-repo

Use `git subtree split -P <name of the folder in the Git repo> -b feature/split` to move a folder into a new branch.

Then create a new Git repository using

[source, bash]
----
mkdir ~/new-repo
cd ~/new-repo
git init
----

Pull the created branch into the new repository with

    git pull ~/my-big-repo feature/split

Thatâ€™s it. Your new repo has now only the related commit in there.
