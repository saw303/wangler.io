= Run Flightrecorder for your Gradle tests

Recently we where running into strange `OutOfMemoryErrors` while Gradle was executing our integration tests.
In order to get a better insight on whats going wrong we decided let http://hirt.se/blog/?p=370[Java Flightrecorder] profile the test execution.

All you need to do is to but the following snippet into your `build.gradle`. This will enable Flightrecorder and it will
record the whole test execution and writes the result to a file called `build/dumponexit.jfr`.

```
test {
      maxHeapSize = "2g"
      jvmArgs += ["-XX:+UnlockCommercialFeatures", "-XX:+FlightRecorder"]

      def jfrOptions = [
              defaultrecording: true,
              dumponexit      : true,
              dumponexitpath  : "${project.buildDir}/dumponexit.jfr",
              globalbuffersize: '10M',
              disk            : true,
              settings        : "${System.getProperty("java.home")}/lib/jfr/profile.jfc".toString()
      ]
      jvmArgs += ["-XX:FlightRecorderOptions=${jfrOptions.collect { k, v -> "$k=$v".toString() }.join(',')}"]
  }
```

Hope that blog post helps.
